## Concept

As a manager I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles. 

&nbsp;

## Goals

- Build a command-line application that accepts user input
- When prompted for my team members and their information an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
- When I click on an email address in the HTML my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
- When I click on the GitHub username that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
- When I start the application I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
- When I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
- When I select the engineer option I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
- When I select the intern option I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
- Once I decide to finish building my team I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
